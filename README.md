## How to run

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Roadmap
* It would be desireable porting the game to typescript.
* It would be desireable separating the game into different files so we can scale it following the design patterns we decide.
* It would be desireable supporting multiple levels. As the game runs inside a HTML canvas, we could just keep every scene as a different canvas and load them in succession.
