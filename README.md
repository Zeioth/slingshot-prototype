## How to run

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Roadmap
* It would be desireable porting the game to typescript.
* It would be desireable separating the game into different files so we can scale it following the design patterns we decide.
* It would be desireable supporting multiple levels by using `engine.world = scenes[sceneIndex].world`.
* It would be desireable creating a pause function, so nothing is clickable while we show the `Stage Cleared!` message, except for the `Next` UI button.
